### **A template for writing Uniswap v4 Hooks ðŸ¦„**

[`Use this Template`](https://github.com/uniswapfoundation/v4-template/generate)

1. The example hook [Counter.sol](src/Counter.sol) demonstrates the `beforeSwap()` and `afterSwap()` hooks
2. The test template [Counter.t.sol](test/Counter.t.sol) preconfigures the v4 pool manager, test tokens, and test liquidity.

### Check Forge Installation
*Ensure that you have correctly installed Foundry (Forge) Stable. You can update Foundry by running:*

```
foundryup
```

> *v4-template* appears to be _incompatible_ with Foundry Nightly. See [foundry announcements](https://book.getfoundry.sh/announcements) to revert back to the stable build



## Set up

*requires [foundry](https://book.getfoundry.sh)*

```
forge install
forge test
```

### Testnet development steps:

1. Use an RPC URL from a node provider like Alchemy on the network of your choice.
2. Run ```forge init``` and then run the first script to deploy the hook:
```
forge script script/00_Counter.s.sol \
    --rpc-url <RPC_URL> \
    --private-key <PRIVATE_KEY> \
    --broadcast
```
3. Then deploy the 01_CreateToken.s.sol script similarly to deploy two Tokens and mint 1000 of each to your wallet address.
4. Now, we have to add the token and hook addresses in the Config.sol file in script/base.
5. Make sure you have the right Pool Manager and Position Manager addresses mentioned in the Constants.sol file in script/base.
6. The last step is to create a pool with the two tokens and the hook attached to it. Run the 01_CreatePoolAndMintLiquidity.s.sol script for the same.



### *Permission Denied*

When installing dependencies with `forge install`, Github may throw a `Permission Denied` error

Typically caused by missing Github SSH keys, and can be resolved by following the steps [here](https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/connecting-to-github-with-ssh) 

Or [adding the keys to your ssh-agent](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent#adding-your-ssh-key-to-the-ssh-agent), if you have already uploaded SSH keys

### Hook deployment failures

Hook deployment failures are caused by incorrect flags or incorrect salt mining

1. Verify the flags are in agreement:
    * `getHookCalls()` returns the correct flags
    * `flags` provided to `HookMiner.find(...)`
2. Verify salt mining is correct:
    * In **forge test**: the *deployer* for: `new Hook{salt: salt}(...)` and `HookMiner.find(deployer, ...)` are the same. This will be `address(this)`. If using `vm.prank`, the deployer will be the pranking address
    * In **forge script**: the deployer must be the CREATE2 Proxy: `0x4e59b44847b379578588920cA78FbF26c0B4956C`
        * If anvil does not have the CREATE2 deployer, your foundry may be out of date. You can update it with `foundryup`
